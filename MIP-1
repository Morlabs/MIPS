# MIPs
  
MIPs (“Morpheus Improvement Proposals”) are the design documents used to propose changes to the Mor Labs ecosystem. 
They provide information to the Mor Labs community that describes a new feature for MOR Labs, or its ecosystem. 
The MIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. 
They are modeled after [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/) and [ZEIPs](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-protocol-governance-voting-walkthrough-and-faq-3becfd57a370). 
See here for an [EIP template](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md) and [ZEIP template](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). 

We intend for MIPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features, collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into the products, protocols and processes used by MOR Labs.
MIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of an implementation. 

# What is the lifecycle of a MIP? 

A successful MIP will move along the following stages: Draft ⟶ Last Call ⟶ Final ⟶ Approved.
Unsuccessful states are also possible: Abandoned and Rejected.

## Draft
A MIP that is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes. 
In order to proceed to “Last Call,” the implementation must be complete. 
Every MIP author is responsible for facilitating conversations and building community consensus for the proposal.

## Last Call
A MIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience. 
If upon review, there is a material change or substantial unaddressed complaints, the MIP will revert to "Draft". 
If the MIP requires code changes, the core devs must review the MIP. 
A successful MIP will be in "Last Call" status for a reasonable period of time for comments and be merged (if necessary) before moving to a tokenholder vote. 

## Final
An MIP that successfully passes the "Last Call" will move to the "Final" state and be put to MOR Labs tokenholder vote. 

## Approved
If tokenholders approve the proposal, the live protocol will be updated to reflect it. 
At this time, any code changes (if relevant) should be merged into the core protocol repository so that the core protocol repository always reflects the live code that is running.
The MIP is then considered to be in the "Approved" state. 

## Abandoned
If at any point during the MIP Finalization Process, a MIP is abandoned, it will be labeled as such. 
Grounds for abandonment include a lack of interest by the original author(s), or it may not be a preferred option anymore.

## Rejected
If tokenholders do not approve a proposal, or the MIP is fundamentally broken or rejected by the CRG, it will not be implemented.
